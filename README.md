## About

### What is Concrete ML Extensions

Concrete ML Extensions by [Zama](https://github.com/zama-ai) is a helper package that helps developers build applications based on **Concrete ML**. It implements low-level cryptographic functions using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE). 
<br></br>

### Main features

- **Fast encrypt-clear matrix multiplication**: This library implements a matrix product between encrypted matrices and clear matrices.
- **Python and Swift bindings for matrix multiplication client applications**: This library contains bindings that help developers build client applications on various platforms, including iOS.
- **Encryption/Decryption to [TFHE-rs](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml) ciphertexts**: To provide interoperability with TFHE-rs ciphertexts, Concrete ML Extensions offers encryption and decryption functions that are used in Concrete ML.

*Learn more about Concrete ML Extensions features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/concrete-ml).*

## Installation

Depending on your OS, Concrete ML Extensions may have GPU support.

|                 OS / HW                 | Available  | Has GPU support |
| :-------------------------------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------: |
|                  Linux x86              |         Yes         |       Yes        |
|                 Windows                 |         No         |        N/A        |
|            macOS 11+ (Intel)            |         Yes         |       No        |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon: M1, M2, etc.) |     Yes     |       No        |

>[!Note]
>Concrete ML Extensions only supports Python `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11` and `3.12`.

### Pip

Concrete ML Extensions is installed automatically when installing Concrete ML. To install manually from PyPi, run the following:

```
pip install concrete-ml-extensions
```

To use the GPU, a CUDA-enabled GPU with support for CUDA >=11.2 should be available on the target machine.

### From Source For Python

This repository leverages `pyo3` to interface TFHE-rs code in python. First, setup the virtual environment. 
Install the build tool `maturin` and the rust compiler. 

```
make install_rs_build_toolchain
poetry install
pip install maturin
```

Next, using `maturin` in the virtual environment, build the wheel and install it to the virtual
environment. Build the wheel in release mode so that tfhe-rs is built in release as well.

```
source .venv/bin/activate
maturin develop --release
```

To compile for GPU, a CUDA-toolkit version >= 11.2 should be installed on the machine, along with 
a compatible `gcc` version (the package compilation is tested with gcc 11.4).  

### From Source for iOS

You can also use Concrete ML Extensions in iOS projects. To do so:

1. Compile the library for both iOS and iOS simulator targets (produces two `.a` static libs).
2. Generate Swift bindings (produces `.h`, `.modulemap` and `.swift` wrapper).
3. Package everything into an `.xcframework` (produces `.xcframework`).
4. Use the `.xcframework` in your iOS project.

##### 1. Compile the library
```shell
    cargo build --no-default-features --features "use_lib2" --lib --release --target aarch64-apple-ios
    cargo build --no-default-features --features "use_lib2" --lib --release --target aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

You may need to install 2 additional target architectures.

```shell
    rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim
```

##### 2. Generate Swift bindings
```shell
    cargo run \
        --bin uniffi-bindgen \
        --no-default-features \
        --features "uniffi/cli swift_bindings" \
        generate --library target/aarch64-apple-ios/release/libconcrete_ml_extensions.dylib \
        --language swift \
        --out-dir GENERATED/
```

Now, three files have been generated in the `GENERATED` subdirectory:
- `concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.h`
- `concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.modulemap`.
- `concrete_ml_extensions.swift`

The two `*FFI` files compose the low-level C FFI layer: The C header file (.h) declares the low-level structs and functions for calling into Rust, and the .modulemap exposes them to Swift. We'll create a *first* module with these (called concrete_ml_extensions) 

This is enough to call the Rust library from Swift, but in a very verbose way. Instead, you want to use a higher-level Swift API, using the `*.swift` wrapper. This wrapper is uncompiled swift source code; to use it you can:
- Either drag and drop it as source in your app codebase (simpler)
- Or compile it in a second module of its own, and use it as compiled code (more complex)
You can read more about why UniFFI split things that way: https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/0.27/swift/overview.html

Next steps:
1. Move .h and .module in an include folder, and rename `<name>.modulemap` to `module.modulemap` (.xcframework and Xcode expect this name).
```shell
    mkdir -p GENERATED/include
    mv GENERATED/concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.modulemap GENERATED/include/module.modulemap
    mv GENERATED/concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.h GENERATED/include/concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.h
```

##### 3. Create an `.xcframework` package

```shell
    xcodebuild -create-xcframework \
        -library target/aarch64-apple-ios/release/libconcrete_ml_extensions.a \
        -headers GENERATED/include/ \
        -library target/aarch64-apple-ios-sim/release/libconcrete_ml_extensions.a \
        -headers GENERATED/include/ \
        -output GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework
```

##### 4. Use the `.xcframework` in your iOS project
- Copy .xcframework into your project
- Add it to `Target > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`
- Select `Do Not Embed` (it's a static lib)
- Copy `concrete_ml_extensions.swift` (as source code) in project

##### Troubleshooting:
*Error message*:

```
   "failed to get iphoneos SDK path: SDK "iphoneos" cannot be located"
```    
Solution: Ensure Xcode.app/Settings/Locations/Command Line Tools is set to the right version.

*Error message*:

```
   Multiple commands produce '...Xcode/DerivedData/Workspace-ejeewzlcxbwwtbbihtdvnvgjkysh/Build/Products/Debug/include/module.modulemap'
```

To fix, a workaround [suggested here](https://github.com/jessegrosjean/module-map-error) is to wrap the .h and .modulemap in a subfolder:

```shell
    mkdir -p GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64/Headers/concreteHeaders
    mkdir -p GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator/Headers/concreteHeaders
    mv GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64/Headers/concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.h \
        GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64/Headers/module.modulemap \
        GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64/Headers/concreteHeaders
    mv GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator/Headers/concrete_ml_extensionsFFI.h \
        GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator/Headers/module.modulemap \
        GENERATED/ConcreteMLExtensions.xcframework/ios-arm64-simulator/Headers/concreteHeaders
```
